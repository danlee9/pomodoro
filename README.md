The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method for getting work done

Basic Principles:

```
1. Work on task in consistent "pomodoro" intervals set to 20 to 30 minutes
2. Take a short break around 5 minutes after each pomodoro
3. After Four Pomodoros take a longer break from 15 to 25 minutes
4. Repeat until task is finished
```

Using Simple Pomodoro:

```
1. Start off with selecting options
	  -Pomodoro Length (20, 25, or 30 mins)
	  -Short Break (3, 5, or 7 mins)
	  -Long Break (15, 20, or 25 mins)
2. Press start to begin timer (Won't start until options for each setting are chosen)
3. Next, previous, and pause/play buttons will adjust timers accordingly
